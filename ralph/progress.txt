## Codebase Patterns
- Translation verification uses tasks/translation-issues.json with structured format (verifiedTerms[], suggestions[], issues[])
- Authoritative Arabic programming sources: Hsoub Academy (academy.hsoub.com), Arabic Wikipedia (ar.wikipedia.org), Hsoub Wiki (wiki.hsoub.com)
- All 20 first glossary terms verified accurate: algorithm, array, assignment, block, boolean, bug, class, comment, comparison-operator, concatenation, conditional, constant, constructor, data-type, debugging, default-value, each, enumerable, exception, expression
- The glossary.json file has excellent Arabic quality - only 1 minor issue (missing period) found across 67 terms
- Glossary definitions should consistently end with periods
- The blocks section (yield.md, procs-lambdas.md) has excellent tanween consistency
- The oop section (initialize-accessors.md, inheritance.md) is very clean with no grammar issues
- The block-syntax.md file has issues in the each_char example section
- The challenges section (fizzbuzz.md, calculator.md, guessing-game.md) is very clean with no grammar issues
- The modules section (modules-mixins.md) uses "مرحباً" correctly in code blocks
- The errors section (error-handling.md) has no tanween issues
- The course.json file uses a nested structure: sections[].lessons[].exercise{starterCode, expectedOutput, hints[], defaultInput?}
- Lesson title "مرحبا بالعالم" needs tanween for consistency - affects validation when corrected
- App pages with Arabic text: layout.tsx (metadata), page.tsx (preview code), glossary/page.tsx (search UI), progress/page.tsx (progress UI), lessons/[section]/[lesson]/LessonPlayground.tsx (default code)
- Most app page files have clean Arabic text - only app/page.tsx and LessonPlayground.tsx have tanween issues

## 2026-01-26 - US-011
- What was implemented: Verified first 20 glossary terms (algorithm through expression) against authoritative Arabic programming resources
- Files changed:
  - Created: tasks/translation-issues.json (verification results for 20 terms)
  - Updated: ralph/prd.json (marked US-011 as passes: true)
- Findings: All 20 terms verified as accurate
  - 20 verified terms with consistent industry-standard translations
  - 0 translation issues requiring changes
  - 1 suggestion noted (hash/قاموس is acceptable, though جدول تجزئة is more technical)
- Terms verified:
  - algorithm (خوارزمية) - confirmed by Hsoub Academy
  - array (مصفوفة) - confirmed by Arabic Wikipedia and Hsoub
  - block (كتلة) - confirmed by Hsoub Ruby documentation
  - boolean (منطقي) - confirmed by Hsoub Wiki
  - class (صنف) - confirmed by Arabic Wikipedia and Hsoub
  - constructor (مُنشئ) - confirmed by multiple sources
  - debugging (تصحيح الأخطاء) - confirmed by Arabic Wikipedia
  - And 12 more terms all verified
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hsoub Academy (academy.hsoub.com) is the most comprehensive Arabic programming resource
  - Arabic Wikipedia has dedicated pages for key CS terms (صنف, جدول تجزئة, نوع بيانات)
  - The glossary translations are high quality and consistent with industry standards
  - Some terms have multiple acceptable translations (e.g., concatenation: سلسلة/دمج, constructor: مُنشئ/الدالة البانية)
  - User-friendly terms (قاموس for hash) are appropriate for beginner courses vs technical terms (جدول تجزئة)

## 2026-01-26 - US-010
- What was implemented: Scanned all 9 .tsx files in app/ directory for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - tasks/grammar-issues.json (added GI-046 to GI-049, updated summary and metadata)
  - ralph/prd.json (marked US-010 as passes: true)
- Findings: 4 new issues identified (total now 49)
  - 4 consistency issues (tanween usage - 'مرحبا' vs 'مرحباً')
  - 0 punctuation issues
- Files scanned:
  - app/layout.tsx (0 issues) - metadata only, clean Arabic
  - app/page.tsx (3 issues) - preview code in homepage has tanween issues
  - app/glossary/layout.tsx (0 issues) - metadata only
  - app/glossary/page.tsx (0 issues) - search UI text is clean
  - app/progress/layout.tsx (0 issues) - metadata only
  - app/progress/page.tsx (0 issues) - progress UI text is clean
  - app/lessons/[section]/[lesson]/page.tsx (0 issues) - breadcrumb/navigation only
  - app/lessons/[section]/[lesson]/LessonContent.tsx (0 issues) - no hardcoded Arabic text
  - app/lessons/[section]/[lesson]/LessonPlayground.tsx (1 issue) - default starter code
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Most app page files have clean Arabic metadata and UI text
  - The app/page.tsx homepage has preview code displayed to users - this code has 3 tanween issues
  - The LessonPlayground.tsx has default starter code that shows when no exercise is defined
  - Layout files only contain metadata descriptions - generally very clean
  - The progress/page.tsx has celebratory exclamation marks in the "completed all lessons" message - these are appropriate
  - Arabic aria-labels and button text in app pages are well-written

## 2026-01-26 - US-008
- What was implemented: Scanned public/course.json for Arabic grammar issues (10 sections, 32 lessons)
- Files changed:
  - Updated: tasks/grammar-issues.json (added 6 new issues, GI-038 to GI-043)
  - Updated: ralph/prd.json (marked US-008 as passes: true)
- Findings: 6 new issues identified (total now 43)
  - 5 consistency issues (tanween usage - "مرحبا" vs "مرحباً" in hello-world lesson)
  - 1 punctuation issue (exclamation mark in truthiness hint)
- Areas scanned:
  - Section titles (10 total) - all clean
  - Lesson titles (32 total) - 1 issue (hello-world)
  - Exercise starterCode comments - 1 issue
  - Exercise expectedOutput fields - 1 issue
  - Exercise hints arrays - 3 issues
- **Learnings for future iterations:**

  - Most exercises have excellent Arabic grammar - only the hello-world lesson has consistency issues
  - The "مرحبا بالعالم" issue appears in multiple places (title, starterCode, expectedOutput, hints) - all need to be fixed together
  - When fixing expectedOutput, the lesson content (hello-world.md) must also be updated to match
  - Most hints use proper punctuation - only 1 exclamation mark issue found
  - The hints array uses Arabic text for explanations, Ruby code samples are embedded inline

- Grammar issues are tracked in tasks/grammar-issues.json with structured JSON format
- Each issue has: id, file, line, original, issue (Arabic description), suggestion, category
- Categories include: consistency, punctuation, spelling, grammar
- The summary section tracks totals by category and file
- Arabic content should use consistent tanween (التنوين) - prefer "مرحباً" over "مرحبا"
- Exclamation marks in intro paragraphs (e.g., "هنا يأتي دور X!") should be periods
- Exclamation marks are acceptable in: warnings, tips/reminders, code output (e.g., "انطلق!"), greetings
- Methods section files (defining-methods.md, returns-splat.md) have excellent tanween consistency

---

## 2026-01-26 - US-001
- What was implemented: Scanned 4 getting-started lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Created: tasks/grammar-issues.json
