## Codebase Patterns
- The blocks section (yield.md, procs-lambdas.md) has excellent tanween consistency
- The oop section (initialize-accessors.md, inheritance.md) is very clean with no grammar issues
- The block-syntax.md file has issues in the each_char example section
- The challenges section (fizzbuzz.md, calculator.md, guessing-game.md) is very clean with no grammar issues
- The modules section (modules-mixins.md) uses "مرحباً" correctly in code blocks
- The errors section (error-handling.md) has no tanween issues

## 2026-01-26 - US-006
- What was implemented: Scanned 1 modules, 1 errors, and 3 challenges lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Updated: tasks/grammar-issues.json (added 2 new issues, GI-035 to GI-036)
  - Updated: ralph/prd.json (marked US-006 as passes: true)
- Findings: 2 new issues identified (total now 36)
  - 0 consistency issues (tanween usage is correct in all files)
  - 2 punctuation issues (exclamation marks in intro text)
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/modules/modules-mixins.md (1 issue)
  - content/lessons/errors/error-handling.md (1 issue)
  - content/lessons/challenges/fizzbuzz.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/challenges/calculator.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/challenges/guessing-game.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The challenges section is very clean - all 3 files have no grammar issues
  - Exclamation marks in game outputs (e.g., "أعلى!", "أقل!", "مبروك!") are appropriate as feedback
  - Exclamation marks with emojis at the end (e.g., "حظاً موفقاً! 🎯") are acceptable as encouraging endings
  - The modules-mixins.md and error-handling.md both have similar intro patterns "هنا تأتي X!" that should be periods
  - This completes the grammar scanning of ALL 37 lesson files

  - content/lessons/oop/initialize-accessors.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/oop/inheritance.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The blocks section (yield.md, procs-lambdas.md) has excellent tanween consistency - uses "مرحباً" correctly throughout
  - The oop section files (initialize-accessors.md, inheritance.md) are very clean with no issues
  - The classes-objects.md file has issues in the "everything is an object" demonstration section (line 29-30)
  - The block-syntax.md issue is in the each_char iteration example

- Grammar issues are tracked in tasks/grammar-issues.json with structured JSON format
- Each issue has: id, file, line, original, issue (Arabic description), suggestion, category
- Categories include: consistency, punctuation, spelling, grammar
- The summary section tracks totals by category and file
- Arabic content should use consistent tanween (التنوين) - prefer "مرحباً" over "مرحبا"
- Exclamation marks in intro paragraphs (e.g., "هنا يأتي دور X!") should be periods
- Exclamation marks are acceptable in: warnings, tips/reminders, code output (e.g., "انطلق!"), greetings
- Methods section files (defining-methods.md, returns-splat.md) have excellent tanween consistency

## 2026-01-26 - US-004
- What was implemented: Scanned 4 collections and 2 methods lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Updated: tasks/grammar-issues.json (added 3 new issues, GI-029 to GI-031)
- Findings: 3 new issues identified (total now 31)
  - 3 consistency issues (tanween usage - مرحبا vs مرحباً)
  - 0 punctuation issues
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/collections/arrays.md (1 issue)
  - content/lessons/collections/array-methods.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/collections/hashes.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/collections/ranges-enumerables.md (2 issues)
  - content/lessons/methods/defining-methods.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/methods/returns-splat.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The methods section has excellent tanween consistency - all instances use "مرحباً" correctly
  - Exclamation marks in greetings (e.g., "مرحباً أحمد!") are appropriate and should NOT be flagged
  - Collections section array-methods.md and hashes.md are very clean
  - The ranges-enumerables.md has issues in the string slicing example section

## 2026-01-26 - US-003
- What was implemented: Scanned 3 control-flow and 2 loops lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Updated: tasks/grammar-issues.json (added 3 new issues, GI-026 to GI-028)
- Findings: 3 new issues identified (total now 28)
  - 0 consistency issues (tanween usage is correct in these files)
  - 3 punctuation issues (exclamation marks in explanatory intro text)
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/control-flow/conditionals.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/control-flow/case-when.md (1 issue)

  - content/lessons/loops/for-control.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Control-flow and loops sections have good tanween consistency (no issues found)
  - Intro paragraphs tend to use exclamation marks like "هنا يأتي دور X!" - these should be periods
  - Exclamation marks in code output (e.g., "انطلق!" in countdowns) are contextually appropriate
  - Exclamation marks in warnings, tips, and error comments are acceptable
  - The conditionals.md file is very clean with no grammar issues

  - content/lessons/fundamentals/multiple-assignment.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The fundamentals section has better tanween consistency than getting-started
  - truthiness.md has multiple exclamation marks in puts statements inside code blocks
  - Some files like string-interpolation.md, operators.md, boolean-logic.md are clean
  - Code block comments (# comment) should also be checked for consistency

## 2026-01-26 - US-001
- What was implemented: Scanned 4 getting-started lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Created: tasks/grammar-issues.json
- Findings: 12 issues identified
  - 10 consistency issues (tanween usage - مرحبا vs مرحباً)
  - 2 punctuation issues (exclamation marks in explanatory text)
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/getting-started/what-is-ruby.md (2 issues)
  - content/lessons/getting-started/hello-world.md (4 issues)
  - content/lessons/getting-started/output-methods.md (5 issues)
  - content/lessons/getting-started/comments.md (1 issue)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase uses "مرحباً" with tanween as the preferred form in most places
  - When scanning for issues, skip code blocks (```ruby ... ```) but DO check inline code within Arabic text
  - Exercise expected outputs need special attention - changing them affects test validation
  - The JSON structure in grammar-issues.json should include metadata about scan date and story ID
