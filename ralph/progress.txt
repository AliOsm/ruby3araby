## Codebase Patterns
- Grammar issues are tracked in tasks/grammar-issues.json with structured JSON format
- Each issue has: id, file, line, original, issue (Arabic description), suggestion, category
- Categories include: consistency, punctuation, spelling, grammar
- The summary section tracks totals by category and file
- Arabic content should use consistent tanween (التنوين) - prefer "مرحباً" over "مرحبا"
- Exclamation marks in intro paragraphs (e.g., "هنا يأتي دور X!") should be periods
- Exclamation marks are acceptable in: warnings, tips/reminders, code output (e.g., "انطلق!"), greetings

## 2026-01-26 - US-003
- What was implemented: Scanned 3 control-flow and 2 loops lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Updated: tasks/grammar-issues.json (added 3 new issues, GI-026 to GI-028)
- Findings: 3 new issues identified (total now 28)
  - 0 consistency issues (tanween usage is correct in these files)
  - 3 punctuation issues (exclamation marks in explanatory intro text)
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/control-flow/conditionals.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/control-flow/case-when.md (1 issue)
  - content/lessons/control-flow/ternary.md (2 issues)
  - content/lessons/loops/while-until.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/loops/for-control.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Control-flow and loops sections have good tanween consistency (no issues found)
  - Intro paragraphs tend to use exclamation marks like "هنا يأتي دور X!" - these should be periods
  - Exclamation marks in code output (e.g., "انطلق!" in countdowns) are contextually appropriate
  - Exclamation marks in warnings, tips, and error comments are acceptable
  - The conditionals.md file is very clean with no grammar issues

## 2026-01-26 - US-002
- What was implemented: Scanned 11 fundamentals lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Updated: tasks/grammar-issues.json (added 13 new issues, GI-013 to GI-025)
- Findings: 13 new issues identified (total now 25)
  - 6 consistency issues (tanween usage - مرحبا vs مرحباً)
  - 7 punctuation issues (exclamation marks in explanatory text)
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/variables-types.md (3 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/string-interpolation.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/operators.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/boolean-logic.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/truthiness.md (5 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/constants-symbols.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/string-methods.md (3 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/bang-predicate.md (2 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/user-input.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/type-conversion.md (0 issues)
  - content/lessons/fundamentals/multiple-assignment.md (0 issues)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The fundamentals section has better tanween consistency than getting-started
  - truthiness.md has multiple exclamation marks in puts statements inside code blocks
  - Some files like string-interpolation.md, operators.md, boolean-logic.md are clean
  - Code block comments (# comment) should also be checked for consistency

## 2026-01-26 - US-001
- What was implemented: Scanned 4 getting-started lesson markdown files for Arabic grammar issues
- Files changed:
  - Created: tasks/grammar-issues.json
- Findings: 12 issues identified
  - 10 consistency issues (tanween usage - مرحبا vs مرحباً)
  - 2 punctuation issues (exclamation marks in explanatory text)
- Files scanned:
  - content/lessons/getting-started/what-is-ruby.md (2 issues)
  - content/lessons/getting-started/hello-world.md (4 issues)
  - content/lessons/getting-started/output-methods.md (5 issues)
  - content/lessons/getting-started/comments.md (1 issue)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase uses "مرحباً" with tanween as the preferred form in most places
  - When scanning for issues, skip code blocks (```ruby ... ```) but DO check inline code within Arabic text
  - Exercise expected outputs need special attention - changing them affects test validation
  - The JSON structure in grammar-issues.json should include metadata about scan date and story ID
